        <h2>What are they going to do?</h2>
        <p>
            They are going to open a big portal to the realm of the Pallas's cat. 
            The portal is going to let an army of hyperintelligent Pallas's cats through and they will soon take over the world. 
            The war will last seven hours. 
            <red><b>They will win.</b>  </red>
            They will slowly harvest the planet of its resources. 
            They will move humanity into a number of cities, and drug the water to pacify them. 
            They will build big citadels. They will experiment with human genetics, creating supersoldiers. I love them so much.
