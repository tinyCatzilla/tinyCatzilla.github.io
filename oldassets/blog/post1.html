        <h1>The Next Step to Regaining Control</h1>
        <p>
          I'm conflicted on whether this is the right topic for my first blog post. It's a personal topic for me, which urges me to do it justice. One reason that I want to write posts is to improve my writing skill, so it doesn't seem right to do yet. There is also a case to be made about setting achievable goals, and the importance of starting off strong, which disincentivizes me from tackling a post like this. But it is always better to act decisively in the wrong direction, than to lay inert, never moving at all.

        This idea is in fact, intimately related to this incoherent yapfest. At some point in my life, I lost control of it -- I'm sure this has happened to everyone, in varying degrees. It manifested as a period of lethargy, where I at gave at most a perfunctory attempt to keep up with school. I let my spirit die. As I pick up the pieces, I reflect on that loss as the true tipping point for me. Now, I do everything in my power to find time for the things closest to my soul.

        I don't want to write anymore, nor do I want to publish this. I hope nobody finds this page. I certainly won't be making a hotlink to it. I'll get back to this if I choose to prioritize it a little higher.
